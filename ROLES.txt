1.this is java base application and developers simply check in the code into the git repository
2.as a devops engineer one of my core responsibilty is to setup the ci/cd pipelines fo which i am using jenkins
3.so my responsibilty is to design the groovy script jenkins files for trigerring all stages of ci/cd.
4.we receive notifications directly via webhook which i have configured and once jenkins receives notifications
jenkins actucally download the code build the code with the help of maven where in the artifacts gets created
5.then i have configured jenkins to deploy this artifacts into the testing servers,we have a team of testers to
create automation testing programs with tools like selenium.
6.i have configured my jenkins to download this selenium programs and execute them so that i can perform testing
and once the testing is successful the next stage jenkins would deploy it to the preprod environment.
7.where it actually taken approvals from the concerned team and there it again executes some UAT scripts which are created by
the testers
8.this is the common flow of ci/cd which we have implemented.
9.our sprint duration is some where between 2-4 weeks and its my responsibilty to design these groovy sripts
files for every releases that is happening during sprint activities
10.Apart from these though our sprint duration is approximatetly 4 weeks we also have sub-sprints which are 
as small a 2 days or 3 days or something like that and this sub sprints would be related to bug fixing and 
enhancemnets
11.and for this sub-sprints also minor releases happen so its my responsibilty to create corresponding jenkins
files and see that the neccassary ci/cd flow happens
12.apart from this we also have lot of other scenarious where we run parallel multiple jenkins jobs and to ensure
that the jenkins master does not go down what we have done is we have created additional slave machines and
distributed workload to these slave machines
13.the branching stratagy that our devolopers actually use is for every functionality they create a seprate
feature branch we also have main branch which is called a release branch
14.Indivdual functionality code devlopers put on the feature brach and once the code is fully created it is
merged to the release branch
15.we also have something called as hotfix branch where all the bug fixing and all those things are done
16.Because we have a lot of multiple branches for each and every feature i have actually designed a multi pipeline branch
17.wherein we created a multiple jenkins files for each and every branch and to ensure that the same code is 
reused in these jenkins files for mutiple times
18.i have configured shared libraries where we have created customised reusable functions which we are called in 
my pipeline programs and ci/cd flow is performed.
19.apart from these we use docker to a huge extension in our orginazation and as i told you earlier this is a java
base application where our databases are running on oracle and our application servers are running on tomcat
20.now this entire dev environment i have setup in a form of docker container for which i have created the docker composer files,
similarly i was responsible for converting legacy applications into the docker based applications and my core responsiblity over
here is to design the docker files for that.
21.so i create docker files so that i understand the existing architecture and based on that i design the docker files create 
customised images and these images i am uploading in the docker private registry a ECR registry which we have actually setup.
